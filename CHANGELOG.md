- Stopped the dungeon filter UI from recursing into a long refresh loop while repainting Blizzard-backed activity selections.
- Kept the safer immediate checkbox refresh behavior for Blizzard-backed dungeon filters without requiring unsafe protected calls.

## v2.0.9

- Stopped Oak windows from continuing to follow Blizzard's Dungeons & Raids frame after the user places them
- so reset/fresh install still dock while normal dragging stays where you put it.
- Fixed the search browser comp column to render filled role slots from Blizzard role counts when per-member class details are unavailable.
- Fixed a load-breaking Lua syntax error introduced during the drag hotfix pass.

## v2.0.8

- Reduced browser drag jitter by backing off auto-clamping while Oak windows are actively being dragged or resized.

## v2.0.7

- Kept the taint fix by resolving fallback activityIDs through a fresh secure lookup instead of addon-owned secret tables.
